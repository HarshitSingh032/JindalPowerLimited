### **Supply Chain Operations in a Coal-Based Thermal Power Plant – Internship at Jindal Power Limited (Tamnar)**

As part of our academic curriculum, we undertook a one-month industrial training at **Jindal Power Limited (JPL), Tamnar**, one of India’s largest private sector thermal power plants. The internship aimed to provide in-depth exposure to the plant’s end-to-end operational processes, especially in relation to the **supply chain of raw materials (coal), by-products (ash), and critical consumables (like hydrogen and water)**. The training served as a practical learning experience to understand how large-scale energy generation facilities manage procurement, logistics, storage, operations, and waste in a synchronized and sustainable manner.

### **Overview of JPL Tamnar**

JPL Tamnar is a state-of-the-art coal-based thermal power plant located in the Raigarh district of Chhattisgarh, India. With an installed capacity of 3400 MW, the plant relies primarily on **supercritical steam technology** to achieve high efficiency and lower emissions. Given its scale and operational complexity, JPL presents a rich case for studying industrial supply chains under high-demand and continuous-operation scenarios.

### **Objective of the Project**

The key objectives of this internship project were:

1. To gain practical understanding of **coal procurement, transportation, and handling**.
2. To observe the **coordination between departments** (operations, logistics, environment, and maintenance) involved in material flow.
3. To analyze the **consumption data** of coal, hydrogen, and water and draw insights from usage trends.
4. To study **ash handling systems**, environmental compliance practices, and sustainable resource utilization.
5. To assess operational data through **visualization and polynomial regression** for performance analysis.

### **Coal Supply Chain Management**

The coal supply chain forms the backbone of the thermal power plant. During the internship, we closely examined each stage of coal movement — from sourcing to combustion:

* **Procurement:** JPL sources its coal primarily from nearby mines in Chhattisgarh. During supply fluctuations or quality issues, imported coal (with higher calorific value and lower ash content) is used.

* **Transportation:** Coal is transported via railways and conveyor systems. We studied the real-time logistics control and scheduling, which ensures a steady and buffer supply of coal to avoid interruptions.

* **Storage and Handling:** At the site, coal is stored in open yards and covered sheds to manage moisture content. It is crushed and screened for uniform particle size. Advanced conveyor systems feed the prepared coal into pulverizers, ensuring smooth flow to the boiler furnaces.

We analyzed **coal consumption patterns across several days** using provided operational data and plotted graphs using Excel. The trend lines showed fluctuations due to external factors like demand variability and maintenance schedules. Polynomial regression analysis was used to forecast consumption and identify peaks and troughs.

### **Boiler Operations and Combustion Supply**

The pulverized coal enters the **boiler furnace**, where it is burned at high temperatures to generate steam. The **boilers operate at 250 bar and 600°C**, making them supercritical units with high thermal efficiency. Combustion air, sourced from **preheated air systems**, contributes to energy-efficient burning.

The **supply chain synchronization** here lies in the continuous, real-time feeding of pulverized coal, accurate air-fuel ratio control, and automated safety shutdown systems that ensure operational stability.

---

### **Ash Handling and Disposal Systems**

Coal combustion generates large amounts of **fly ash and bottom ash**, both of which must be handled efficiently to maintain operational safety and environmental compliance.

We studied the complete ash handling system comprising:

* **Bottom Ash Handling:** Handled using submerged scraper conveyors and clinker grinders. The system continuously removes ash during boiler operation.
* **Fly Ash Handling:** Managed through Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) that capture up to 99.9% of particulate matter, with ash transported via **pneumatic conveying systems** to silos.
* **Ash Disposal:** Ash slurry pumps move ash to disposal ponds lined with HDPE to prevent seepage.

JPL also utilizes ash in **cement manufacturing and road construction**, turning waste into a resource — a sustainable model of circular economy.

### **Hydrogen and Water Supply Logistics**

In addition to primary inputs, we evaluated the **supporting supply chains** for consumables such as hydrogen and water.

* **Hydrogen Cylinders:** Used for generator cooling due to hydrogen’s superior heat transfer characteristics. We plotted hydrogen consumption over 90 days and found it to be **uniform and stable**, suggesting strong inventory planning and predictive replenishment strategies.

* **Make-Up Water Consumption:** Water is essential for steam generation and cooling. Consumption trends showed a **declining pattern**, likely due to seasonal shifts and process optimization. Water is sourced responsibly, treated in effluent systems, and reused, indicating compliance with environmental norms.

---

### **Technology and Data Analysis**

Throughout the project, we used tools such as:

* **MS Excel:** For plotting graphs, analyzing trends, and regression modeling.
* **SCADA dashboards:** (Observed on-site) for real-time tracking of operational parameters.
* **Emission monitoring systems:** To understand compliance and reporting mechanisms.
* **Plant maintenance records and logs:** To correlate consumption dips with shutdowns.

We applied **polynomial trendlines (6th-degree)** to visualize daily coal and water consumption, which helped in highlighting operational inconsistencies and planning efficiency improvements.

---

### **Sustainability and Environmental Compliance**

A significant aspect of JPL’s supply chain is its alignment with environmental regulations:

* **Emission Controls:** ESPs, FGD units (Flue Gas Desulfurization), and Low-NOx burners reduce particulate and gaseous emissions.
* **Water Recycling:** Closed-loop systems reduce freshwater intake.
* **Fly Ash Utilization:** Supports infrastructure industries, reducing landfill dependency.
* **Green Initiatives:** Tree plantations, dust suppression, and continuous monitoring reinforce the plant's sustainability goals.

These initiatives reflect a modern supply chain strategy — one that’s not only efficient and cost-effective but also sustainable and compliant.

### **Key Takeaways and Learning Outcomes**

1. **End-to-End Visibility:** Understood how each component (procurement, logistics, operation, disposal) integrates in a power plant’s supply chain.
2. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Learned how operational trends guide planning, stocking, and system optimization.
3. **Technology Integration:** Observed how SCADA and other systems provide real-time operational intelligence.
4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Witnessed coordination among departments like fuel management, operations, and environmental compliance.
5. **Sustainability Mindset:** Appreciated the efforts taken to turn by-products into usable resources and maintain regulatory standards.
